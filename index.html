                        In this book, I have gathered my deepest thoughts, feelings, and desires for you. Each page is
                        full of love and dedication, reflecting how much you mean to me. Even though distance separates
                        us, I want you to know that you are always in my heart and thoughts.
                        I hope you enjoy every word and that this book makes you feel as special as you make me feel.
                        With all my love

                        always in balance. In every videomessage, I find your light; in every message,
                        your calm. Together, we overcome the distance, creating a perfect harmony
                        that transcends space and time.
